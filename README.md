### QUESTION 5.
Make a program where, when the user enters a number between 1 and 7, the program throws a message that indicates to which day that entered number corresponds, in addition, if the user enters a number that is not between 1 and 7, the program must ask enter another number between that range and when entering the number 9 the program closes.

### QUESTION 6.

Write a program that calculates the total owed by a customer at a restaurant. 
The program should ask the customer to enter the charge for the food, then calculate the amounts of an 20 percent tip and 8 percent sales tax. 
Display each of these amounts and the total in the following format:</br>

*The tip owed is $___.*

*The sales tax owed is $___.*

*The total amount owed is $___.*

The output should be a multi-line string and ___ should be replaced by actual values in by your program output.

### QUESTION 7.
Write a program that prompts a user to enter a number between 1 and 100. 
If a number outside of this boundary is entered or if a non-number is entered, reply with an error message. 
Otherwise, determine whether the number if even or odd. 
Subsequently, print out a statement describing whether the entered number if even or odd.


### QUESTION 8.
The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot be made by mixing other colors. 
When you mix two primary colors, you get a secondary color, as shown here:

*When you mix red and blue, you get purple.*</br>
*When you mix red and yellow, you get orange.*</br>
*When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.*</br>

Design a program that prompts the user to enter the names of two primary colors to mix. 
If the user enters anything other than a primary color (red, blue, or yellow), the program should display an error message. 
Otherwise, the program should display the name of the secondary color that results.

### QUESTION 9.
Write a while loop that lets the user enter a number. 
The number should be multiplied by 10, and the result assigned to a variable named product. 
The loop should iterate as long as the product is less than 100.

### QUESTION 10.
Write a for loop that displays the following set of numbers:</br>
*0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 . . . 100*

### QUESTION 11.
Write a loop that asks the user to enter a number. 
The loop should iterate 10 times and keep a running total of the numbers entered.

### QUESTION 12.
Write a program that prints numbers starting at 20 and ending at 0. 
For every odd number, print "Buzz" instead of the number, and for every even number, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

### QUESTION 13.
Write a program with a loop that asks the user to enter a series of positive numbers. 
The user should enter a negative number to signal the end of the series. 
After all the positive numbers have been entered, the program should display the sum.

### QUESTION 14.
At one college, the tuition for a full-time student is $8,000 per semester. 
It has been announced that the tuition will increase by 3 percent each year for the next 5 years. 
Write a program with a loop that displays the projected semester tuition for the next 5 years.

### QUESTION 15.
Write a program that uses a nested loops to draw this pattern:

### *******

### ******

### *****

### ****

### ***

### **

### *

### QUESTION 16.
Write a program that prints out all numbers from list_a: [0,1,2,3,4,5] that do not have a corresponding number in another list_b: [1,3,5,7,9]. 
When a number in list_a is determined to not have a duplicate in list_b, print out "{num} is not in list_b".

*For example: "0 is not in list_b"*</br>
*list_a = [0,1,2,3,4,5]*</br>
*list_b = [1,3,5,7,9]*

### QUESTION 17.
Write a function named times_ten. The function should accept an argument and display the product of its argument multiplied by 10.

### QUESTION 18.
Write a program that asks a user to enter a distance in kilometers, then converts that distance to miles and prints it out. 
The conversion formula is as follows:</br>
*# Miles = Kilometers x 0.6214*

### QUESTION 19.
Write a function count_up that prints out a number up to and including the passed in parameter number.

### QUESTION 20.
The program should receive input from a user that will enter the amount to deposit into the piggybank. 
Use a function, add, which takes an argument number from the user input and adds it to a global sum variable. 
After the 5th deposit, print out the running total thus far.

### QUESTION 21.

The program should allow a user to enter a string input and print out a number response.

### QUESTION 22.
Write a function that accepts two string arguments: str and substr. 
The function should count the number of times the substr is in str and return that number.

### QUESTION 23.
Given this string: *"Hello, my name is Joe. I love long walks in the park and staring at stars at night."*

Write a program that prints out the following:</br>

1. The number of upper case letters in the string
2. The number of lower case letters in the string
3. The number of whitespace characters in the string

### QUESTION 24.
Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of single-digit numbers with nothing separating them. 
The program should display the sum of all the single-digit numbers in the string. </br>
*For example, if the user enters 1234, the method should return 10, which is the sum of 1, 2, 3, and 4.*
