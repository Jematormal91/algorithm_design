### QUESTION 7.
Write a program that prompts a user to enter a number between 1 and 100. 
If a number outside of this boundary is entered or if a non-number is entered, reply with an error message. 
Otherwise, determine whether the number if even or odd. 
Subsequently, print out a statement describing whether the entered number if even or odd.


### QUESTION 8.
The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot be made by mixing other colors. 
When you mix two primary colors, you get a secondary color, as shown here:

When a number in list_a is determined to not have a duplicate in list_b, print out "{num} is not in list_b".

*For example: "0 is not in list_b"*</br>
*list_a = [0,1,2,3,4,5]*</br>
*list_b = [1,3,5,7,9]*

### QUESTION 17.
Write a function named times_ten. The function should accept an argument and display the product of its argument multiplied by 10.

### QUESTION 18.
Write a program that asks a user to enter a distance in kilometers, then converts that distance to miles and prints it out. 
The conversion formula is as follows:</br>
*# Miles = Kilometers x 0.6214*

### QUESTION 19.
Write a function count_up that prints out a number up to and including the passed in parameter number.

### QUESTION 20.
The program should receive input from a user that will enter the amount to deposit into the piggybank. 
Use a function, add, which takes an argument number from the user input and adds it to a global sum variable. 
After the 5th deposit, print out the running total thus far.

### QUESTION 21.
Write a program that counts all the vowels in a string. 
The program should allow a user to enter a string input and print out a number response.

### QUESTION 22.
Write a function that accepts two string arguments: str and substr. 
The function should count the number of times the substr is in str and return that number.

### QUESTION 23.
Given this string: *"Hello, my name is Joe. I love long walks in the park and staring at stars at night."*

Write a program that prints out the following:</br>

1. The number of upper case letters in the string
2. The number of lower case letters in the string
3. The number of whitespace characters in the string

### QUESTION 24.
Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of single-digit numbers with nothing separating them. 
The program should display the sum of all the single-digit numbers in the string. </br>
*For example, if the user enters 1234, the method should return 10, which is the sum of 1, 2, 3, and 4.*

### QUESTION 25.
Design a program that generates an 8-digit passcode consisting of random numbers. 
The program should generate eight random numbers, each in the range of 0-9, and assign each number to a list. 
Then write another loop that displays the contents of the list.

### QUESTION 26.
A positive integer greater than 1 is said to be prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. 
A positive integer greater than 1 is composite if it is not prime. 
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 1, then displays all of the prime numbers that are less than or equal to the number entered. 
Once the user has entered a number, the program should populate a list with all of the integers from 2 up through the value entered.
The program should then use a loop to step through the list. 
The loop should pass each element to a function that displays the element whether it is a prime number.

### QUESTION 27.
Given the following list and nested lists:</br>
*scores = [['Jack', 'Josh', 'Joe'],[90, 88, 56],[67, 88, 87],[88, 99, 78]]*</br>

Write a program that turns this into an ASCII art table with the scores in their correct places.</br>
*You may design the table however you like.*</br>
*The nested lists are the rows and the indexes of the nested lists are the columns.*</br>
*In the end, you should have a table with 4 rows (first one being the student names) and 3 columns (one for each student).*

### QUESTION 28.
A grocery store has a reward system that gives customers redeemable points based on the amount spent on groceries. 
The points are awarded as follows: </br>
* If a customer spends <= $50, they are awarded 1 point for each dollar spent.
* If a customer spends > $50 and < $150, they are awarded 2 points for each dollar spent
* If a customer spends >= $150, they are awarded 3 points for each dollar spent.
*You can assume all grocery items are priced to the dollar with tax included (no cents).*

Write a program that asks a customer to enter the total dollar amount spent for the trip, then displays the number of points awarded.

### QUESTION 29.
Define an input that accepts an age (number), check if infant, child, teenager, or adult.

### QUESTION 30.
Write a while loop that lets a user enter a number less than 10. 
If the number inputted exceeds 10, print an error and ask for the number again, in which a user may enter the same or a different number. 
The number should be incremented by 5, and the result assigned to a variable named sum. 
The loop should continue to iterate as long as the sum is less than 50. When sum exceeds 30, it should print *"Almost there..."* until it reaches or exceeds 50. Once it does, print out *"your final sum is {replace with final sum}". *

*For example, if the sum is currently 45 and the user inputs 4, the program will not enter the loop again since the new sum will be 54 and should then print "your final sum is 45".*

### QUESTION 31.
The flowchart shows a program's steps to troubleshooting a lamp issue. 
Write a program where the first prompt to the user is *"What is wrong?"*. 
If the user enters *"Lamp doesn't work"*, then the program should proceed to ask the questions depicted in the diagram and print out the responses accordingly. 
*If any other issue is inputted initially by the user, ignore and repeat the same initial question until the correct issue is presented by the user.*
