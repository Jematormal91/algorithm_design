### QUESTION 5.
Make a program where, when the user enters a number between 1 and 7, the program throws a message that indicates to which day that entered number corresponds, in addition, if the user enters a number that is not between 1 and 7, the program must ask enter another number between that range and when entering the number 9 the program closes.

### QUESTION 6.

Write a program that calculates the total owed by a customer at a restaurant. 
The program should ask the customer to enter the charge for the food, then calculate the amounts of an 20 percent tip and 8 percent sales tax. 
Display each of these amounts and the total in the following format:</br>

*The tip owed is $___.*

*The sales tax owed is $___.*

*The total amount owed is $___.*

The output should be a multi-line string and ___ should be replaced by actual values in by your program output.

### QUESTION 7.
Write a program that prompts a user to enter a number between 1 and 100. 
If a number outside of this boundary is entered or if a non-number is entered, reply with an error message. 
Otherwise, determine whether the number if even or odd. 
Subsequently, print out a statement describing whether the entered number if even or odd.


### QUESTION 8.
The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot be made by mixing other colors. 
When you mix two primary colors, you get a secondary color, as shown here:

*When you mix red and blue, you get purple.*</br>
*When you mix red and yellow, you get orange.*</br>
*When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.*</br>

Design a program that prompts the user to enter the names of two primary colors to mix. 
If the user enters anything other than a primary color (red, blue, or yellow), the program should display an error message. 
Otherwise, the program should display the name of the secondary color that results.

### QUESTION 9.
Write a while loop that lets the user enter a number. 
The number should be multiplied by 10, and the result assigned to a variable named product. 
The loop should iterate as long as the product is less than 100.

### QUESTION 10.
Write a for loop that displays the following set of numbers:</br>
*0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 . . . 100*

### QUESTION 11.
Write a loop that asks the user to enter a number. 
The loop should iterate 10 times and keep a running total of the numbers entered.

### QUESTION 12.
Write a program that prints numbers starting at 20 and ending at 0. 
For every odd number, print "Buzz" instead of the number, and for every even number, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
